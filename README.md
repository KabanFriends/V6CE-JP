This is a fork of Terry Cavanagh's flippy platformer game named VVVVVV that's focused on adding more tools for custom levels to use. We focus exclusively on the desktop version of the game. We make sure to always keep up with upstream.

The original repository for VVVVVV is located at [TerryCavanagh/VVVVVV](https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/VVVVVV).

The features that this version includes, along with a list of who has contributed, is located in [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md).

Most of our discussion is concentrated in [the VVVVVV Discord server](https://discord.gg/Zf7Nzea).

[Terry Cavanagh has granted us an exception to VVVVVV's custom license](https://twitter.com/terrycavanagh/status/1216657316067663872), letting us distribute our fork with `data.zip` included, provided we do not distribute any of the original main game levels.
